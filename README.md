# IJulia

**IJulia** is a [Julia-language](http://julialang.org/) backend
combined with the [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) interactive
environment (also used by [IPython](http://ipython.org/)).  This
combination allows you to interact with the Julia language using
Jupyter/IPython's powerful [graphical
notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html), which combines code,
formatted text, math, and multimedia in a single document.  It
also works with [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), a Jupyter-based
integrated development environment for notebooks and code.

(IJulia notebooks can also be re-used in other Julia code via
the [NBInclude](https://github.com/stevengj/NBInclude.jl) package.)


## Quick start

Install IJulia from the REPL by pressing `]` to enter pkg mode and entering

```
add IJulia
```

If you already have Python/Jupyter installed on your machine, this process will also install a
[kernel specification](https://jupyter-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/kernels.html#kernelspecs)
that tells Jupyter how to launch Julia. You can then launch the notebook server the usual
way by running `jupyter notebook` in the terminal.

Alternatively, you can have IJulia create and manage its own Python/Jupyter installation.
To do this, type the following in Julia, at the `julia>` prompt:

```julia
using IJulia
notebook()
```

to launch the IJulia notebook in your browser.
The first time you run `notebook()`, it will prompt you
for whether it should install Jupyter.  Hit enter to
have it use the [Conda.jl](https://github.com/Luthaf/Conda.jl)
package to install a minimal Python+Jupyter distribution (via
[Miniconda](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/install/quick.html)) that is
private to Julia (not in your `PATH`).

For more advanced installation options, such as specifying a specific Jupyter
installation to use, see the [documentation](https://JuliaLang.github.io/IJulia.jl/stable).
