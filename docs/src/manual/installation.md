# Installation

## Installing IJulia

1. [Go to the Julia Install page.](https://julialang.org/install/)
2. Follow the instructions recommended to install Julia and the `juliaup` tool.
3. Run the Julia application by double-clicking on the icon or running
   `julia` in a terminal. This will open the Julia REPL and a window with
   a `julia>` prompt will appear.
4. At the `julia>` prompt, install IJulia by typing:

   ```julia
   using Pkg
   Pkg.add("IJulia")
   ```

!!! info
    This process installs a
    [kernel specification](https://jupyter-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/kernels.html#kernelspecs)
    for IJulia. The IJulia kernelspec, shorthand for kernel specification,
    contains the instructions for launching a Julia kernel that a notebook
    frontend (Jupyter, JupyterLab, nteract) can use. The kernelspec does not
    install the notebook frontend.

    IJulia respects the standard
    [`JUPYTER_DATA_DIR`](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/stable/use/jupyter-directories.html#data-files)
    environment variable, so you can set that before installation if you want
    the kernel to be installed in a specific location.

!!! warning
    The command, `Pkg.add("IJulia")`, does not install Jupyter
    Notebook itself.

    You can install Jupyter Notebook by following the Notebook's
    installation instructions if you want. Conveniently, Jupyter
    Notebook can also be installed automatically when you run
    `IJulia.notebook()`. 
    See [Running the Julia notebook](running.md#Running-the-IJulia-Notebook).
    
    You can direct `IJulia.notebook()` to use a specific Jupyter
    installation by setting `ENV["JUPYTER"]` to the path of the
    `jupyter` program executable. This environment variable should
    be set before `Pkg.add` or before running `Pkg.build("IJulia")`,
    and it will remember your preference for subsequent updates.

## Updating Julia and IJulia

Julia is improving rapidly, so it won't be long before you want to
update your packages or Julia to a more recent version.  

### Update packages

To update the packages only and keep the same Julia version, run
at the Julia prompt (or in IJulia):

```julia
Pkg.update()
```

### Update Julia and packages

If you download and install a new version of Julia from the Julia web
site, you will also probably want to update the packages with
`Pkg.update()` (in case newer versions of the packages are required
for the most recent Julia). If you're using juliaup to manage Julia, then for
every Julia *minor release* you will need to explicitly update the IJulia
installation to tell Jupyter where to find the new Julia version:
```julia
Pkg.build("IJulia")
```

This is because IJulia creates default kernels for every minor version if
juliaup is used.

If you are not using juliaup to manage Julia, then you *must* update the IJulia
installation every time you install a new Julia binary (or do anything that
*changes the location of Julia* on your computer).


!!! important
    `Pkg.build("IJulia")` **must** be run at the Julia command line.
    It will error and fail if run within IJulia.

## Installing and customizing kernels

You may find it helpful to run multiple Julia kernels to support different Julia
executable versions and/or environment settings.

You can install one or more custom Julia kernels by using the
[`IJulia.installkernel`](@ref) function. For example, if you want to run Julia
with all deprecation warnings disabled, you can create a custom IJulia kernel:

```julia
using IJulia
installkernel("Julia nodeps", "--depwarn=no")
```
and a kernel called `Julia nodeps 0.7` (if you are using Julia 0.7)
will be installed (will show up in your main Jupyter kernel menu) that
lets you open notebooks with this flag. Note that the default kernel
that IJulia installs passes the `--project=@.` option to Julia, if you
want to preserve this behaviour for custom kernels make sure to pass it
explicitly to `IJulia.installkernel`:
```julia
installkernel("Julia nodeps", "--depwarn=no", "--project=@.")
```

You can also install kernels to run Julia with different environment
variables, for example to set
[`JULIA_NUM_THREADS`](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/environment-variables/index.html#JULIA_NUM_THREADS-1)
for use with Julia
[multithreading](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/parallel-computing/#Multi-Threading-(Experimental)-1):
```julia
using IJulia
installkernel("Julia (4 threads)", env=Dict("JULIA_NUM_THREADS"=>"4"))
```

The `env` keyword should be a `Dict` which maps environment variables to values.

To *prevent* IJulia from installing a default kernel when the package is built,
define the `IJULIA_NODEFAULTKERNEL` environment variable before adding or
building IJulia.

## Low-level IPython Installations

We recommend using IPython 7.15 or later as well as Python 3.

### Using legacy IPython 2.x version

We recognize that some users may need to use legacy IPython 2.x.  You
can do this by checkout out the `ipython2` branch of the IJulia package:

```julia
Pkg.checkout("IJulia", "ipython2")
Pkg.build("IJulia")
```

### Manual installation of IPython

First, you will need to install a few prerequisites:

* You need **version 3.0** or later of IPython, or version 4 or later
  of Jupyter.  Note that IPython 3.0 was released in February 2015, so
  if you have an older operating system you may have to
  [install IPython manually](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/stable/install/install.html).
  On Mac and Windows systems, it is currently easiest to use the
  [Anaconda Python](http://continuum.io/downloads) installer.

* To use the [IPython notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) interface, which runs in your web
  browser and provides a rich multimedia environment, you will need
  to install the [jsonschema](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/jsonschema), [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/), [Tornado](http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/),
  and [pyzmq](https://github.com/zeromq/pyzmq) (requires `apt-get install libzmq-dev` and possibly `pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall pyzmq` on Ubuntu if you are using `pip`) Python packages.
  (Given the [pip](http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/) installer, `pip install jsonschema jinja2 tornado pyzmq`
  should normally be sufficient.)  These should have been automatically installed if you installed IPython itself
  [via `easy_install` or `pip`](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/stable/install/install.html#quickstart).

* To use the [IPython qtconsole](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/interactive/qtconsole.html) interface,
  you will need to install [PyQt4](http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download) or
  [PySide](http://qt-project.org/wiki/Category:LanguageBindings::PySide).

* You need Julia version 0.7 or later.

Once IPython 3.0+ and Julia 0.7+ are installed, you can install IJulia from a Julia console by typing:

```julia
Pkg.add("IJulia")
```

This will download IJulia and a few other prerequisites, and will set up a
Julia kernel for IPython.

If the command above returns an error, you may need to run `Pkg.update()`, then
retry it, or possibly run `Pkg.build("IJulia")` to force a rebuild.
