# IJulia

**IJulia** is a [Julia-language](http://julialang.org/) backend
combined with the [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) interactive
environment (also used by [IPython](http://ipython.org/)).  This
combination allows you to interact with the Julia language using
Jupyter/IPython's powerful [graphical
notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html), which combines code,
formatted text, math, and multimedia in a single document.  It
also works with [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), a Jupyter-based
integrated development environment for notebooks and code.

(IJulia notebooks can also be re-used in other Julia code via
the [NBInclude](https://github.com/stevengj/NBInclude.jl) package.)
